Want to help out with this knowledgebase? Look no further! Getting started is super easy.

<p>

<h4>Fork the repository on Github</h4>
<p>

Head to <a href="https://github.com/LocalMonero/Knowledge/">github.com/LocalMonero/Knowledge</a> and click "Fork" on the Github. If you don't have a Github account, it will prompt you to create one, which is pretty easy!
<p>

<p>
<h4>Editing the page directly in Github</h4>
Once that's complete, find a page you want to edit.html and open it. It should look something like this; then you can click Edit:
<p>

<p>
Copy everything in the file and heading to <a href="https://htmledit.squarefree.com">htmledit.squarefree.com</a>, so you can somewhat see your changes in real time. Keep in mind, any images or pretty syntax will not show up. If you want them, you'll have to download the project locally and use Git like a normal person!
<p>
Once you're done, paste the changes back into Github and scroll to the bottom. Enter a commit message that describes what you changed, and tick "Create new branch" so you can seamlessly send a merge request with it:

<p>
<h4>Sending in your change</h4>
Now that your commit is completed, you can send in your change! Click "Compare across forks" to get started.

<p>
In the next screen, you'll want to select the left repository to be LocalMonero's. Click on it and select LocalMonero/Knowledge from the list:
<p>
<img src="Select LocalMonero.png" alt="Selecting LocalMonero image">
<p>
Lastly, click "Create Pull Request" and a moderator will see it merged! You can do this as many times as you'd like to as many different files as you'd like. If you want to do more complex editing locally, such as images, or larger changes, feel free to do that as well (although it's out of the scope of this tutorial for now!).
