<h4>Getting some Monero</h4>
<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky"> There's two main ways to purchase Monero: the first is to buy Bitcoin, then buy Monero with it, and the second is to buy Monero directly. Lastly, if you don't want to use an exchange, sites like <a href="https://localmonero.co/">LocalMonero.co</a> allow you to trade with other users directly, so you can buy Monero that way too!

<h4>Getting a Wallet</h4>

    Wallets are important; they're what make Cryptocurrencies decentralized. It means you can control the mathematical keys that ensure only you have access to your funds, and that nobody else can stop you from using them.
    <p>
    The first thing to do is find a wallet that suites your needs - and there's tons to select from! Are you interested in completely maximizing your privacy, or is having private transactions enough for you? Are you interested in having an easy setup, or would you rather have full control over everything?
    <p>
    The one thing to remember about any wallet is to write down the <i>mnemonic seed</i> it gives you. This will allow you to always access your funds!
