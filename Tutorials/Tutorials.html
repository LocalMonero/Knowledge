<h4>Spending Monero</h>
<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky"> Want to spend Monero privately, and support stores that accept it too? The first thing you need to do is download a wallet (or don't, there's webwallets). When choosing a wallet, there's a few things you want to keep in mind. Are you interested in completely maximizing your privacy, or are having private transactions enough? Are you interested in having an easy setup, or would you rather have full control over everything?
<p>
    The one thing to remember about any wallet is to write down the <i>mnemonic seed</i> it gives you. Keeping this safe will ensure you have full access to your funds if your harddrive fails, or if your house ever burns down!
