# RandomX
RandomX is Monero's PoW algorithm as of November 2019 that aims to bring longer term ASIC resistance to Monero than previous CryptoNight variants. It uses random code execution optimized for CPUs to minimize any advantage of specialized hardware.

## History
### CryptoNight
Monero is based on the cryptonote protocol, which implements CryptoNight as memory-hard hashing algorithm to reduce the benefit of ASICs. 
### RandomJS
After ASICs were found on CryptoNight, tweaks started being made each hardfork to break their compatibility. Monero contributor Howard Chu, notable for founding [OpenLDAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenLDAP) (a database layer that underlines much of the telecommunications industry), devised a plan for random Javascript code generation and execution he called RandomJS. RandomJS was later abandoned for RandomX, for a number of reasons, including an ASIC for RandomJS could be a hardware implemented Javascript compiler.
