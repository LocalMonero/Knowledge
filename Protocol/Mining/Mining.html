Monero uses PoW to validate transctions - This means users called "miners" group transactions into a block, verify them, and submit them to be added to the blockchain. Miners get a small amount of Monero every time they successfully compute a block.

<h4>Monero Mining History</h4>
<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-0pky">Monero has always been an ASIC-resistant coin. It was originally built with on Cryptonight, a memory hard hashing algorithm. The idea was anyone could mine on a regular CPU and have a chance at earning Monero while supporting the network, and building ASICs would be extremely expensive for a small edge; however the sheer price of Monero still drove ASIC manufacturers into the market, and changing the hashing algorithm every 6 months earned heavy community criticism. So in May 2018, a new idea to hash based on random code execution was born in November 2019, after completing 4 audits, RandomX went live.
